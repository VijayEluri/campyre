Steps to set up and use:

1) Copy keys.example.xml to res/values/keys.xml.
2) Open project in Eclipse and all that (assuming you have your Android dev environment set up).
3) Fill in your details in keys.xml. "username" is the subdomain of the room, "email" and "password" are your credentials, "room_id" is the numeric ID of the room, visible in the URL when you're in it. "ssl" is if you use https, just leave it blank if you're not on the $50/month plan or higher.
4) Install on your phone through the SDK and go.
5) Realize that you are an amazing and unique human being.

This only works for non-SSL rooms right now.
