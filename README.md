# Android Campfire Client

A basic Campfire client for Android phones. Will be released on the Market for free.  Code is open source. Help out!

## To Use

Open the app to log in with your credentials.  The app only supports non-SSL (<$50/month) accounts right now.  It'll remember your credentials and your session.

Also, you can Share images from your Gallery through the phone.  Campfire will appear on the Share menu, and will upload the picture immediately.

## Roadmap

Visit the [Issues page](http://github.com/klondike/android-campfire/issues) to see what's on the schedule for 0.9 (first Market release, but not feature-complete), 1.0 (Basic features complete), and 1.1 (First tier of nice-to-haves).
